# Welcome to Front End Template!

Here you will find the following workflows with solutions to:

- Building a website from scratch
- Navigation for mobile and desktop for responsive design
- Sass 7-1 Architecture (Credit to [KittyGiraudel's Sass Boilerplate](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate))
- Common mixins that help simplify your CSS code for common breakpoints in different screen sizes

_Note:_ **Ensure your IDE can watch your main.scss file as you work through your Sass code! The index.html file is hooked in with main.css file. I prefer using VSCode along with the Live Sass Compiler.**

Feel free to modify the stylesheets to your needs.

One big reason this was created was to help my workflow efficiency increase. I've found myself constantly going back to old projects to reference similiar code in my new front-end projects.

This template is meant to serve the need to those finding themselves constantly referencing their older front-end projects.

**_In the future, I will be providing more templates for higher levels (Front-End Developers, Senior Devs, etc.) and I will continute to improve this and other templates as I learn more!_**
